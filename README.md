# Machine-learning-basis
This project contains models which were trained by different algorithms to sovle a computer graphing problem. This project bases on different algorithms like DNN, CNN and SVM. This can be a baseline of doing model training in further work. The project was developed by Python on Conda environment.

Each file contains the entire procedure of machine learning processing, from the data cleaning, model training and result analysis.
